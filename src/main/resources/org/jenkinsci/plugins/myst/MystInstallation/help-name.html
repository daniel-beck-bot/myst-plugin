<div>
  The identification name for the MyST Agent. Usually it should be named with the same version name. e.g: 2.4.0.0<br/>
  In case there are multiple MyST agents in this list and the job configuration does not specify the &apos;MyST Installation Name&apos;, then the first MyST Agent instance from this list takes precedence over the others.
